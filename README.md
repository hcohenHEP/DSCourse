# Faulty Version Detector

We present here an approach for the detection of faulty production versions using various time-series analysis and activity features. Using a three months data and a trained machine learning algorithm we were able to predict whether a deployed production version is considered faulty. This study was preformed on data provided by Microsoft compony regarding their product, Application Insights.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisities

The tutorial is written in IPython notebook. The code itself depends on scipy common packages such as numpy, pandas, sklearn etc..

The data files should be located as follows: 

```
initial three months data should be put in local folder named ''data''
```

```
new data for classification should be put in local folder named ''new_data''
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Stay what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
